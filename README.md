# confused-cell-state
This repository is part of the work of my Master's Thesis with the title "Depicting novel tumour cell states through single-cell transcriptome profiles in colorectal cancer".

It includes, in total, 6 R Notebooks:
1) KUL3_NormalCells.RMD
2) KUL3_TumourCells.RMD
3) kul3_PAM.RMD
4) scAnnotatR/TrainingNewModels.RMD
5) scAnnotatR/ClassificationTumourCells.RMD
6) SMC.RMD.

1) and 2) were developed first, in parallel. The rest of the files were developed following the order mentioned above.
